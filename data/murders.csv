The caller said “several males” were in front of a residence “creating a disturbance and brandishing guns.""

The suspects fled in a vehicle before police arrived, but a vehicle carrying Haslip drove by, and the person who had called police identified the car as being involved in the earlier incident. The officer attempted to pull the vehicle over, and Haslip allegedly attempted to flee on foot. The officer captured Haslip and handcuffed him. 

At this point, Haslip was lying on the ground handcuffed, and officers stated that he rolled over onto on side. One officer announced that the subject had a gun, and one or both officers opened fire, killing Haslip. A gun was found in Haslip's possession.
