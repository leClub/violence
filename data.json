The caller said \u201cseveral males\u201d were in front of a residence \u201ccreating a disturbance and brandishing guns.\"\n\nThe suspects fled in a vehicle before police arrived, but a vehicle carrying Haslip drove by, and the person who had called police identified the car as being involved in the earlier incident. The officer attempted to pull the vehicle over, and Haslip allegedly attempted to flee on foot. The officer captured Haslip and handcuffed him. \n\nAt this point, Haslip was lying on the ground handcuffed, and officers stated that he rolled over onto on side. One officer announced that the subject had a gun, and one or both officers opened fire, killing Haslip. A gun was found in Haslip's possession. \n\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/12/handcuffed-man-shot-in-moreno-valley-is-identified.html\n\nhttp://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Teenager-Fatally-Shot-by-Deputy-in-Moreno-Valley-185339072.html\n\nHaslip's mother filed a wrongful death suit, alleging that the officers were poorly trained:\nhttp://www.pe.com/articles/haslip-672006-sheriff-department.html",

The deputy tried to identify himself; the beating continued. The deputy got his car door open, grabbed his gun, and shot one of the men, who died of his injuries. The second would-be robber ran away, and was caught and placed under arrest. The deputy suffered injuries to his head. He was treated at a hospital and released.",

Ed Winter, spokesman for the coroner's office, said authorities  responded to a call regarding a violent female about 5 p.m. When officials arrived, they found Ruvalcaba locked inside a bathroom. Police advised her to come out, but when she did,  she was wielding a knife, Winter said. Ruvalcaba then lunged at an officer. At that point, an officer-involved shooting occurred, he said. The woman was taken to a hospital; however she died less than an hour later from multiple gunshot wounds. Winter had no other details about the case. Anyone with information about the officer-involved shooting is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.",

Deputies had responded to a call of a carjacking in La Puente. Moments later, deputies spotted the car, a white Dodge Charger, on Temple Avenue in La Puente, and a short chase ensued. The chase ended in the 15000 block of Stafford Street, across the street from the sheriff\u2019s station in the City of Industry, said sheriff\u2019s Lt. Kimberly Unland. The driver, later identified as Gonzalez-Torres, got out of the vehicle and fired a handgun at the deputies, who returned fire. Gonzalez-Torres was struck by the gunfire and pronounced dead. A weapon was recovered at the scene, Unland said. Per department procedure, the deputy-involved shooting is being investigated by department homicide detectives and internal affairs officers ...",

When the officers approached the boys, they claim they noticed a large assault rifle sticking out of Herrera's shirt, and immediately began shooting without any warning, according to Istlas. Officers allege the teenager reached for the gun. Family members say they do not know where the gun came from but that it was not loaded. Herrera died on the scene. Istlas was not hurt and says he did not know his friend was armed.",

A witness saw Rutkowski, a resident of the borough, carrying the guns and called police. Officers from Western Berks Regional, Lower Heidelberg Township, Sinking Spring Borough, and South Heidelberg Township police departments responded and ordered Rutkowski to drop his guns. Ignoring their orders, he fled on foot. Police chased Rutkowski to an isolated spot along Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks, just south of Route 422 which traverses the borough. Continuing to ignore commands to put down the guns, Rutkowski allegedly pointed the guns at the officers who opened fire. Rutkowski had Aspergers Syndrome, a mild form of autism characterized by social awkwardness and non-compliant behavior that could have contributed to the incident. He sustained multiple handgun and shotgun wounds and died at the scene. Rutkowski never fired the guns, a semi-automatic pistol and a revolver, which were unloaded.[86]",
